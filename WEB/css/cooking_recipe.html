  <h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>
<p id="intro">
    This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years. <br>
    Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.
</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
    <li>175g of tahini</li>
    <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
    <li>Half a red pepper</li>
    <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
    <li>A dash of olive oil</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
    <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
    <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
    <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste.</li>
  </ol>
    If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time <br>
    If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time <br> <br>

    For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. <br>
  <span id="comment">Experiment and see what works for you.</span>

  <h2>Storage</h2>

    Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.

    Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.
